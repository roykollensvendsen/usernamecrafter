# usernamecrafter
WARNING: This is one of my first C/C++ projects so don't expect much in terms of advanced code. 
User enumeration is becoming more and more important when we are performing password spraying. 
I saw myself needing a tool that can generate userlists fast and the result is this project.
The tool is flexible in the sense that you can specify formats how you see fit with the -f parameter.

I have a pre-compiled version in the x64\Release folder. 
If you don't trust me you can simply fire the project up in Visual Studio and compile it. 

## Speed
Example test from my system when combining a firstname list of 25502 lines, a lastname list containing 1000 and the pattern {firstname}.{lastname}@test.com.
This took 8.8 seconds and generated a wordlist file of 610mb containing 25502001 lines.

## Usage
```
-h, --help       Show this help message and exit\
-F, --firstnames File with firstnames
-L, --lastnames  File with lastnames
-o, --output     Specify output file
-f, --format     Specify format. {firstname}{lastname} or {firstname}(3).{lastname}
-v, --version    Show program version

Example: usernamecrafter.exe -F firstnames.txt -L lastnames.txt -o output.txt -f {firstname}{lastname}
Example: usernamecrafter.exe -F firstnames.txt -L lastnames.txt -o output.txt -f {firstname}.{lastname}@domain.com
Example: usernamecrafter.exe -F firstnames.txt -L lastnames.txt -o output.txt -f {firstname}(1){lastname}
Example: usernamecrafter.exe -F firstnames.txt -L lastnames.txt -o output.txt -f {firstname}{lastname}(2)
Example: usernamecrafter.exe -F firstnames.txt -L lastnames.txt -o output.txt -f {firstname}(3){lastname}(3)
Example: usernamecrafter.exe -F firstnames.txt -L lastnames.txt -o output.txt -f {firstname}(3)_{lastname}(3)@domain.com
```

If you want to do [a-z] you would need to generate a wordlist with a-z and use that as input to either firstname or lastname depending on how you want to use it. 
In Linux you can use this command:
```
echo {a..z} | tr ' ' '\n' > a-z.txt
```

## Other resources
This project does not contain any wordlists, so you have to find them yourselves.
